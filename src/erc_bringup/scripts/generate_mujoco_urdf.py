Generate the MuJoCo-flavoured URDF for the ERC TIAGo Pro dev simulator.

Starts from the competition's pregenerated URDF (erc_description/urdf/
tiago_pro.urdf) so the robot the dev simulator runs is byte-derived from the
one the competition ships: same links, masses, joint limits, meshes and
ros2_control joint set. Applies only what MuJoCo needs:

  1. Strip every <gazebo> element PAL's xacro emits (plugins, sensors,
     friction tags) - MuJoCo reads none of them - along with the transmissions
     and the two laser housings (see strip_laser_housings).
  2. Swap the hardware plugin PAL's xacro emits for
     mujoco_ros2_control/MujocoSystemInterface reading the MJCF from a topic.
  3. Embed a <mujoco_inputs> block for the URDF->MJCF converter:
       - one MuJoCo <position> actuator per commanded joint, gains taken from
         PAL's own tiago_pro_mujoco pids.yaml (p -> kp, u_clamp -> forcerange)
       - <equality> joint couplings replacing the URDF <mimic> four-bar
         constraints that MJCF conversion drops
       - the head camera as a MuJoCo RGB-D camera on the optical frame,
         at the resolution and field of view the competition URDF states
The camera needs no frame of its own: the converter treats the named site as a
REP-103 optical frame and applies the optical->MuJoCo rotation itself.

Run inside the container after building:
